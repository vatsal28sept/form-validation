The Validation project repository offers a simple form validation system implemented using HTML and JavaScript. This project aims to validate user input in a web form before submission, ensuring that the entered data meets certain criteria and preventing invalid data from being processed.# form-validation

The form will load, allowing users to input their data. As users interact with the form, real-time validation feedback will be provided, guiding them to enter valid data. Once all input fields are correctly filled out, users can submit the form, and the data will be processed accordingly.
